# Decentralized Lottery System

A simple and transparent decentralized lottery system built on the Ethereum blockchain. This project ensures fair lottery draws and secure prize distribution without relying on intermediaries.

## Features

- **Decentralized Lottery**: No central authority; all processes are handled by the blockchain.
- **Fairness**: Random winner selection is automated using smart contracts, ensuring unbiased outcomes.
- **Security**: Funds are securely stored on the blockchain, and prize distribution is automatic and tamper-proof.
- **Transparency**: All transactions, including ticket purchases and winner selection, are recorded on the blockchain for public verification.

## Project Overview

This Solidity-based smart contract allows participants to enter a lottery by purchasing tickets. Once a set number of participants join or a specified time elapses, the contract automatically selects a random winner and transfers the prize directly to their wallet. The system leverages blockchain technology to guarantee fairness and prevent tampering.

## Usage

Participants can enter the lottery by sending Ether to the contract address. Once the winner is selected, the contract distributes the prize pool to the winner, making the process fully automated and decentralized.
